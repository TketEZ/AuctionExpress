# databases-auction-site
COMP0022: Database and information systems CW

# Basic Setup
<ol>
<li>From the command line, navigate to where you would like to save the project. From here execute "git clone [repository address]" - this should clone the project into your working directory.</li>
<li>Open WAMP or MAMP and set the Document Root folder (where WAMP/MAMP will look for the website files) to the location where you saved project. In WAMP the default should be the "www" directory, or if using MAMP then "htdocs". In MAMP you can go to preferences -> Web Server to change the document root to the desired location. For WAMP, you can see <a href="https://phantomthemes.com/how-to-change-the-www-root-directory-on-wampserver-3/">here</a> for instructions. (The alternative would be to clone the databases-auction-site project directly into one of these directories, but I think it's easier to access if you choose a convenient loaction for you, rather than having to navigate to the WAMP/MAMP directories each time you want to work on the files.)</li>
<li>Now boot up the WAMP/MAMP server and open the website.</li>
